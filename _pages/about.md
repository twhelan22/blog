I created this page to write about various data science and machine learning projects I have worked on. Previously I wrote a series teaching machine learning with Python through a fantasy football lens, which can be found at [fantasyfutopia.com](http://www.fantasyfutopia.com/python-for-fantasy-football-introduction/).
