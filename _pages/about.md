Hi, I'm Tom Whelan, a data scientist from the UK. I created this page as a central point of reference for blog posts about various projects I have worked on. If you're looking for my series teaching machine learning with Python through a fantasy football lens, you can find it at [fantasyfutopia.com.](http://www.fantasyfutopia.com/python-for-fantasy-football-introduction/)

Feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter ([@tom_whelan](https://twitter.com/tom_whelan)) or via email (tom.whelan@hotmail.co.uk).
